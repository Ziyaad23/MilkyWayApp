# MilkyWayApp

Milky Way App has been developed using MVVM architecture using Combine. Image loading and caching could be improved using SDWebImage or Kingfisher pod.

Difficulties faced: I couldn't implement unit testing with combine. I need to learn more about unit testing.

Things to improve: Unit testing and Combine
